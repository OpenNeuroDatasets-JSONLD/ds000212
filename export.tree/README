Description: 
This dataset contains data on two tasks:
- dis: moral judgments on a 1-4 scale of moral-violation scenarios
	- Scenario breakdown:
		- Items 1-12: Physical harms (e.g., stabbing)
		- Items 13-24: Psychological harms (e.g., insults)
		- Items 25-36: Incest violations (e.g., sleeping with a sibling)
		- Items 37-48: Pathogen violations (e.g., drinking human blood)
		- Items 49-60: Neutral scenarios
	- Condition labels:
		- A_PHA: Accidental physical harms
		- B_PSA: Accidental psychological harms
		- C_IA: Accidental incest violations
		- D_PA: Accidental pathogen violations
		- E_NA: Accidental neutral scenarios
		- F_PHI: Intentional physical harms
		- G_PSI: Intentional psychological harms
		- H_II: Intentional incest violations
		- I_PI: Intentional pathogen violations
		- J_NI: Intentional neutral scenarios
- tom/tomloc/fb: Theory of Mind (ToM) localizer task, including false-belief and false-photo trials (Saxe & Kanwisher, 2003).

Participants:
Participants include neurotypical (NT) participants and participants with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

Data collection:
All data was collected in 2011 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

===========================================

Note: As per submitter "tom, tomloc, and fb are all essentially the same task: a Theory of Mind localizer task. I retained the different names so that, if for some reason we ever had to go back to the experiment scripts, we would have a clear record of which particular script was used for each participant."

Known Issues
------------

BIDS validator throws following warnings.

1) Not all subjects contain the same files. Each subject should contain the same number of files with the same naming unless some files are known to be missing. (code: 38 - INCONSISTENT_SUBJECTS). 
  This is beacuse of same runs in all subjects but named differently as 'task-tom', 'task-tomloc', 'task-fb'. Even though they are same runs they are named diffenetlt for oragnizationl reason explained in above sections.  

2)  Not all subjects/sessions/runs have the same scanning parameters. (code: 39 - INCONSISTENT_PARAMETERS)
